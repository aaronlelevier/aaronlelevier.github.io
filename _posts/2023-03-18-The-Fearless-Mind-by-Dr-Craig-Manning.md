This blog is a summary of key points from [The Fearless Mind](https://thefearlessmind.com/) by Dr. Craig Manning. This book helped me in my daily personal and professional life, and I hope that sharing the following concepts helps you as well.

## **The Fearless Mind**

The Fearless Mind is a state of being where one is mentally positive, confident, and focused on the task at hand.

## **Components of a Fearless Mind**

First, being **confident** is key. A confident person believes in their skills and does not let others affect their efforts. Confidence is increased by learning and developing core skills which improves performance on **tasks**.

A **task** is an activity required in competition, for example a backswing in tennis.

**Focus** on the present improves performance by not thinking about past or future outcomes and instead focusing on tasks. This requires **concentration**.

Focus and concentration require **decision making.** There are two ways to improve decision making. One is through _block practice_, the practice of core skills in isolation. The other is _random-practice_, which is practice that simulates competition.

It is necessary to take calculated **risk** because it improves focus, and can make the difference when other elements in competition are equal.

**Positive** thinking and self-talk is a key element because competition has highs and lows, so it is important to remain positive and not let swings affect performance.

## **General context of the book**

Dr. Manning replicated other top school’s physical training programs for his tennis team, but hit a plateau. He wanted to further improve his team’s performance, which led to him focus on the mental aspect of competiion. What he learned became The Fearless Mind.

## **How did I find out about The Fearless Mind book**

I found out about this book through watching the YouTube film[ 8600FT](https://youtu.be/liFHsc8h0hc) by Canyon Bicycles. Dr. Manning is in the movie, and Braydon Bringhurst, the star of the film, who is attempting to climb 8600FT of the Whole Enchilada trail in Moab, was one of Dr. Manning's students. Bringhurst uses the above strategies openly in the film, especially the positive self-talk strategy.
