This is a personal blog of how this week went. **Warning** this blog isn't meant as boasting. The week went really good. I'm not sure why. I need to find out. If I could have more weeks like this, well then wow! I could only hope. I'm recording this week for myself because it's been pretty special.

## Details

Each section is called out in order of how it happened. No order of importance.

## Work

On Thursday, I gave a presentation to the architects at my work. This was amazing and particulary humbling. At this point, I am a contractor. I work hard and stay focused on my goals at my workplace, and am focused on where I want this to go. For me to give a presentation to the architects, not to get too nervous, and to be able to answer most all their questions was particulary special. I appreciate this opportunity.

### Python coding

I wrote proxy logic for calling any method in a foreing class in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and being able to hook into that method and make calls before or after the method is called. This could be equated to a **vistor decorator**. I am proud of this because I had no idea of how to do it, but I believed that it was possible, and it was. My particular use case was to properly bust the cache. But, doing logging, or any other use case, where a before or after `boto2.client('ec2')` for example out of one of the may remote client visitor calls, well this pattern can be used a lot, needless to say.

## Personal

Read 1 chapter of [Accelerated C++](http://libertar.io/lab/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Andrew-Koening-and-Barbara-E.-Moo-Accelerated-C-.pdf)

Got my C++ environment with [libtortch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/) working and contributed to a [torch.jit](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/pull/138) feature branch

Most intense mountain bike ride yet... yes, I'm still on a Trek DS2

First code review with a senior site reliablity engineer, SRE. It was great feedback. I need to fix up my PR now :)

Passed a code challenge.

I went to a [barber shop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/high-country-barbershop-san-diego-2?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)) and he didn't trim my hair as I asked and I asked him multiple times to correct it until he got it right. I'm proud of this because I stuck up for myself to get the right haircut that I wanted.

## Family

Went to mount Palomar and played in the snow with my family.

My neighbors opened up to me about being able to buy their oldest son eye glasses for seeing in color because he's color blind. They said God bless, because these glasses are expensive, and they don't come from a lot. I look up to them for doing this for thier son. 

## Conclusion

God bless. Thank you. This isn't something that I talk about a lot. I am just so thankful for my current situation, myself and my family for being in such good health. I am so thankful for all that I have. It's obviously something that you can't take for granted. Thank you.
