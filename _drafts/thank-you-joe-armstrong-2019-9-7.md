# Thank you Joe Armstrong

I wish that I would have had the opportunity to meet you. I own your book "POrogramming Erlang 2nd Ed." in both PDF and paperback.

There's a lot of quotes like this in the book:

> The ease with which we can package and encode Erlang terms gives us a significant advantage over text-based methods such as HTTP or XML.

A little bit of it sounds like, "drink some more coolaid". But in all seriousness, you are right sir. Erlang has so many advantages for solving particular problems.

# Protocol notes

Define a protocol for an IAM request, example

```
{
  request_type: assume-role,
  roles: [],
  assume_roles: []
}
```
